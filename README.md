In each game, the program randomly determines a password from a list of 35 possible 5- character passwords, and the user continues attempting to guess that password until they are either successful or give up. The program should allow the user to play as many games as desired. The password breaker game should have two modes, described below:
• Easy mode: The user has an unlimited number of attempts to guess the correct password.
• Hard mode: The user is only allowed a maximum of five guesses. If the user cannot guess the password correctly within five guesses, then they lose the game.

Below is the list of 35 possible 5-character passwords to use for this assignment:
about, found, place, still, three, after, great, plant, study, water, again, house, point, their, where, below, large, right, there, which, could, learn, small, these, world, every, never, sound, thing, would, first, other, spell, think, write.
